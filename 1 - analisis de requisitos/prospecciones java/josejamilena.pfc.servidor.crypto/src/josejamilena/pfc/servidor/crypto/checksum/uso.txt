MD5 checksum can be used to validate a password without passing the actual password.
The server sends a random string to the client.
The client appends his password to the random string, and returns an MD5 sum of the result to the server.
On the server, do the same and compare the MD5 sums.
If both MD5 are identicals then the password is good.
